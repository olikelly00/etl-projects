# etl-projects

This repository contains exercises and demonstrations of **Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL)** workflows using various data sources and technologies. You’ll find examples working with CSVs, APIs, cloud-based files (**S3/Athena**), and relational databases (**PostgreSQL**).

## Contents

### 📡 ETL_from_API_exercise.ipynb  
Demonstrates extracting data from a **REST API**, transforming it in **Python**, and loading it into a local or cloud data store.

### ☁️ ETL_from_Cloud_based_file.ipynb  
Shows how to **download files** from a cloud storage location (e.g., **AWS S3**), apply transformations with **Python/Pandas**, and load them into a target database.

### 📂 ETL_from_large_cloud_based_file.ipynb  
Focuses on handling **larger datasets** with efficient streaming, **chunk processing**, or **Spark-based** approaches.

### 🗄️ ETL_from_relational_database.ipynb  
Illustrates how to **read from one relational database** (e.g., **PostgreSQL**) and load it into another or perform transformations in-between.

### 🔹 etl_bites.ipynb  
A variety of smaller ETL **“bites”** or tasks, often used to **practice incremental learning** of ETL concepts.

### 📄 DataProcessingModernBusinesses.pdf  
Slides or documentation that give an overview of **modern data processing strategies** and **best practices**.

### 🏗️ athena_glue_s3_postgres_interaction.png  
Architecture diagram or reference image demonstrating how **AWS Athena, Glue, S3, and PostgreSQL** interact in an **ETL pipeline**.

### 📜 README.md  
This explanatory file.
